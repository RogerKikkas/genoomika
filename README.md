# Redwood

> **WARNING:** RedwoodJS software has not reached a stable version 1.0 and should not be considered suitable for production use. In the "make it work; make it right; make it fast" paradigm, Redwood is in the later stages of the "make it work" phase.

### Setup

We use Yarn as our package manager. To get the dependencies installed, just do this in the root directory:

```terminal
yarn install
```

Set up environment variables. Copy .env.defaults to .env and change a few of the variables depending on your local setup.

```terminal
docker-compose up -d
yarn redwood prisma migrate dev
yarn redwood prisma db seed
```

Database seed will create a test account with the credentials:
email: admin@admin.com
password: admin

### Fire it up

```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.
